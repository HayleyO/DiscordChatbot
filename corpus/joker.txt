Hello. Hi. Hey there.
Goodbye.See ya. Later.
--is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
It's certainly tense. People are upset, they're struggling. Looking for work. The garbage strike seems like it's been going on forever. These are tough times.
How 'bout you. Have you been keeping up with your journal?
Everyday.
Great. Did you bring it with you?
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?
Arthur, last time I asked you to bring your journal with you. For these appointments. Do you have it?
Yes ma'am.
Can I see it?
I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy?
No. You didn't.
I think I did.
I didn't realize you wanted to read it.
"I just hope my death makes more cents than my life."
Yeah. I mean, that's just--
Does my reading it upset you?
No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know?
I understand. I just want to make sure you're keeping up with it.
How does it feel to have to come here? Does it help having someone to talk to?
I think I felt better when I was locked up, in the hospital.
And have you thought more about why you were “locked up?"
Well I suppose I was mentally ill.
How’s that?
Well my mother thought I was mentally ill, so she had me committed.
Did you feel mentally ill?
They’ve been saying that since I was little. So who knows.
I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase my medication.
Arthur, you’re on seven different medications. Surely they must be doing something.
I just don’t want to feel so bad anymore.
Can you please stop bothering my kid?
I wasn't bothering him, I was--
Just stop.
You think that's funny?
Happy?! Did you check the mail before you came up?
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.
You sure you looked? Sometimes I don't know where your head is.
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. Go lie down, I’m gonna make you some dinner, okay?
He must not be getting my letters.
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom. He's a busy man.
Please. I worked for that family for years. He always had a smile for me. Least he could do is write back.
Ma, eat. You need to eat.
You need to eat. Look how skinny you are.
All day long it's more bad news. That's all there is.
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much television.
Thomas Wayne is our only hope.
He'll make a great mayor. Everybody says so.
Everybody who? Who do you talk to?
Well everybody on the news.
He's the only one who can save this city. He owes it to us.
Come sit. It’s starting. 
Thank you. Glad you're here. We've got a great looking audience tonight.
Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.
Who's that there? Hey Bobby, can you raise the lights for me?
You there, will you stand up? What's your name?
Hi Murray. Arthur. My name is Arthur.
There's something special about you Arthur, I can tell. Where you from?
I live right here in the city. With my mother.
Hold on. There's nothing funny about that. I lived with my mother before I made it. It was just me and her. I'm that kid whose father went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back.
I know what that's like, Murray. I've been the man of the house for as long as I can remember. I take good care of my mother.
All that sacrifice. She must love you very much.
She does. She always tells me to smile and put on a happy face. She says that I was put here to spread joy and laughter.
What? Hold on. Can you say that again?
My mother told me I had a purpose, to bring laughter and joy to the world.
Wow. I like that. I like that a lot.
Okay, we got a big show tonight, stay tuned. We'll be right back.
That was great, Arthur, thanks. I loved hearing what you had to say. Made my day.
Thanks, Murray. You know I grew up without a dad too. He left right after I was born. I don't know what I ever did to him,--
Fuck him. Guy like that doesn't deserve you, Arthur. You see all this, the lights, the show, the, the love of the audience, I'd give it all up in a heartbeat to have a son like you.
You okay?
I heard about the beat down you took. Fucking savages.
It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.
No, they'll take everything from you if you do that, all the crazy shit out there, they're animals,--
My mother says that people nowadays lack empathy.
What's empathy?
It means like "feeling for other people."
Like sympathy?
Kind of. But different.
Take it. You gotta protect yourself out there. Or you're gonna get fucked.
Randall, I'm not supposed to have a gun.
Don't sweat it, Art. No one has to know. And you can pay me back some other time. You know you're my boy.
Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in his office.
Hey Gary, you know what I've always wondered?
What?
